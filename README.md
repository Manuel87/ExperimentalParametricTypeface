**Trouble shooting**
- this version only works in Glyphs 2.0 (although since 2.0 the spacing axis is not working anymore)
- make sure the “Vanilla” is installed (go to Glyphs > Preferences > Addons > Modules and click the Install Modules button)
- if the sliders wont show up again, try to remove the all the current instances
